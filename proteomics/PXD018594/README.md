## Title

Shotgun proteomics of Vero E6 cells infected by Italy-INMI1 SARS-CoV-2 virus


## Description

Next-generation proteomics of Vero E6 cells infected by Italy-INMI1 SARS-CoV-2 virus for defining the kinetics of whole viral particle antigen production for vaccines. Cells from Day1, Day2, Day3, Day4, Day7 post-infection at two multiplicities of infection.


## Sample Processing Protocol

After virus heat inactivation, proteins were extracted. Protein samples were loaded on a SDS-PAGE for a short migration, excised from a single polyacrylamide band, digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by Q-Exactive HF tandem mass spectrometry.


## Data Processing Protocol

MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT, the results were then parsed and protein abundances were compared by spectral counts.
